# SMART Health Card / "Vaccine Passport" Generator

A python script for generating SMART Health Cards.

Obviously the result will only be "valid" if you are considered to be a trusted
issuer (i.e. probably a government, hospital, NGO, etc.) by whatever
person/app is scanning the code. And if that describes you, you probably
shouldn't be using sketchy scripts from github?  But you do you, I guess.
